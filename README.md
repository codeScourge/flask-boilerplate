# flask-react-boilerplate

### motivation
Serverside-rendering is cool, but I like Python for backend.

### content
This boilerplate features a simple flask app which renders an HTML page. Then ReactJS can be used to build this Single-Page-Application. Bundled using Webpack.

### how to run
just run ```bash deploy.sh``` to deploy the application to AWS-Lambda
