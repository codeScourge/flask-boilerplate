# flask-react-boilerplate

### motivation
Serverside-rendering is cool, but I like Python for backend.

### feautes
- Simple flask app which renders an HTML page
- ReactJS for Single-Page-Application, bundled using Webpack
- Docker container for the flask app and docker-compose for managing it

### how to run
- Build the bundle using ``npm run build``
- Run the application using ``docker-compose up --build``
