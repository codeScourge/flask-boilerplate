# flask-react-boilerplate

### motivation
Serverside-rendering is cool, but I like Python for backend.

### content
This boilerplate features a simple flask app which renders an HTML page. Then ReactJS can be used to build this Single-Page-Application. Bundled using Webpack.

### how to run
just do ```docker-compose up --build``` to start your docker-compose app. It should now be available when you enter ```localhost``` in your browser
